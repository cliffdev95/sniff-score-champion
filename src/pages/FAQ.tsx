    q: "Can SniffScore actually smell me?",
    a: "Not yet. Our AI interns are still developing 'Scratch-n-Sniff 2.0'. But we're optimistic about achieving digital olfactory capabilities by 2077!",
  },
  {
    q: "Does deodorant count as a shower?",
    a: "Nice try. That's like using cologne to fix procrastination. Deodorant is a supplement, not a replacement. Science says so. Probably.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I bathe in perfume?",
    a: "You'll smell like a fancy candle that's hiding something. Also, your skin will hate you. Just use water and soap like a normal human.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I improve my SniffScore?",
    a: "Step 1: Water. Step 2: Soap. Step 3: Repeat tomorrow. Revolutionary, we know. We're considering patenting this groundbreaking method.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I challenge my friends to a stink-off?",
    a: "Yes! We call it 'Survivor: Shower Edition.' Loser buys detergent. Winner gets bragging rights and a functional sense of smell.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SniffScore backed by real science?",
    a: "Absolutely! We have a team of imaginary scientists working around the clock. Their credentials are as real as our smell-detection technology.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the world record for not showering?",
    a: "We don't officially track this because we're not monsters. But rumor has it someone named Greg hasn't showered since 2019. Greg, if you're reading this, please bathe.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can pets use SniffScore?",
    a: "Your dog is judging you, not the other way around. But yes, feel free to calculate their score. Just don't tell them the results.",
