    q: "Can SniffScore actually smell me?",
    a: "Not yet. SniffCheck is a playful app and does not actually smell users. Maybe one day in sci-fi future!",

  {
    q: "Does deodorant count as a shower?",
    a: "Deodorant helps but isn't a full replacement for washing. Water and soap are best for cleaning.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I bathe in perfume?",
    a: "Fragrance can mask odors briefly, but regular bathing with water and soap is healthier for your skin.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I improve my SniffScore?",
    a: "Try a quick shower, stay hydrated, and maintain good hygiene habits.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I challenge my friends to a friendly competition?",
    a: "Sure â€” keep it kind and fun. Consider challenges that encourage healthy habits.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SniffScore backed by real science?",
    a: "No. SniffCheck is for entertainment only and not a scientific or medical tool.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the world record for not showering?",
    a: "We don't track that â€” focus on healthy habits instead!",

    q: "Can pets use SniffScore?",
    a: "Pets aren't the intended audience, but you can use the site for fun. Keep pet care in line with veterinarian advice.",
